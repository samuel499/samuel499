## Incorporating Classes, Switch Statements, and Try-Catch-Finally

- **Classes:** In the `script.js` file, a `Calculator` class is defined to perform basic mathematical operations (addition and subtraction).

- **Switch Statements:** Inside the click event listener, a switch statement is used to select the operation to perform (addition or subtraction) based on the value of the `operation` variable.

- **Try-Catch-Finally:** A try-catch block is used to handle errors that may occur during the operation. If an invalid operation is selected, it throws an error, which is caught and logged. The finally block ensures that the code inside it is executed, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

This website demonstrates the use of classes for encapsulation, switch statements for conditional logic, and try-catch-finally for error handling.
